Mental health and COVID-19 vaccine outcomes

COVID-19 vaccines play a major role in preventing people from getting severely ill or dying from COVID-19. Two factors affect how the vaccines can keep protecting people. First, people need to be fully vaccinated. Second, the vaccines need to be effective. This research aims to understand how well COVID-19 vaccines work in people with mental health conditions (eg depression and anxiety). Specifically, we try to understand two questions. First, in the UK population, what proportion of people with mental health conditions are fully vaccinated against COVID-19? Second, whether this group of people are more likely to get infected, get ill, or die due to COVID-19 even after being vaccinated, compared with those without mental health conditions?   
We will use data from the UK LLC to estimate how many people have taken COVID-19 vaccines and how effective the vaccines are, in people with and without mental health conditions. 
This research will help inform healthcare providers on three aspects. First, how to engage and support people with mental health conditions to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Second, how to assist healthcare professionals to deliver vaccines to this group. Third, whether this group will need additional interventions to reduce health risks related to COVID-19.
